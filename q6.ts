6. Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning 
and end of the name. Make sure you use each 
character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the 
name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
